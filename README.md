# HTML Form Generator from JSON Schema

A **vanilla JavaScript** application that takes a JSON schema as input and dynamically renders a styled HTML form. It supports basic input types (`text`, `date`, `textarea`, `select`) and nested schemas through recursive rendering.

The form is rendered using plain DOM manipulation. A recursive `renderSchema` function generates form fields based on the structure of the provided schema.

Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and modern UI. No frameworks or libraries required â€” built with just HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.
